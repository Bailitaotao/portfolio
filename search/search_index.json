The name implies the test's purpose\u2014to screen for \"qualified laborers\" who are emotionally stable, can objectively assess themselves, and are not swayed by subjective emotions. The Voight-Kampff test is from Blade Runner and is used to distinguish between humans and replicants. Its core principle is that humans have an innate capacity for empathy, which replicants lack. The test works by asking the subject a series of morally ambiguous and emotionally charged questions (like the famous \"tortoise in the desert\" question) to monitor involuntary physiological responses such as pupil dilation and heart rate.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Project-IV/delete-me-not/","title":"DELETE ME NOT","text":""},{"location":"Project-IV/delete-me-not/#inspiration","title":"INSPIRATION","text":"<p>My inspiration comes from the explosive development of AI in recent years.
